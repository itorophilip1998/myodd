# Feature: Slip generation & modes

## Purpose

Create ranked booking-code variations from a SportyBet share code and/or a natural-language instruction, within hard odds / market constraints.

## Ownership

| Layer | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Web | `/` — `GenerateForm.tsx`, guardrails in `lib/generate-guardrails.ts` |
| API | `slips/*`, `jobs/create-booking.processor.ts`, `ai/ai.client.ts` |
| AI | `/intent`, `/generate`, `/split` — `apps/ai/app/` |
| Policy | `packages/shared/src/mode-policy.ts`, `chat-request.ts` |

## Entry points

- `POST /api/slips/generate` — code + instruction (or context from an existing collection).
- `POST /api/slips/generate-from-prompt` — prompt-only from upcoming fixtures.
- `POST /api/slips/analyze` — preview original booking without generating.

## Flow

1. Parse instruction (hosted LLM or rules fallback) into a structured config.
2. Score available outcomes (odds / optional trained model).
3. Search unique combinations inside odds bands and market constraints.
4. Enqueue booking tasks; SportyBet confirms each code before persist.
5. Persist generation report (requested/found, substitutions, bounds).

## Named modes

Hard ticket bands and safer per-leg odds (see `MODE_ODDS` / `MODE_SELECTION_ODDS` in shared). Modes also work as typed keywords. Explicit numeric targets narrow the band; contradictory targets fail clearly.

Typical labels: Investor, Gambler (incl. “Gamler”), Japa, Lagoslife / Lagos-Lifes.

## Fixture scope

- Default adaptive: prefer original matches, expand when needed.
- `original_only` / upcoming-only supported via form or language.
- Markets must exist in the live bookmaker catalog; unknown IDs are discarded.

## Constraints

- Football, pre-match; one selection per event.
- Ticket count and games-per-ticket limits enforced in UI + API.
- Nearest-odds adjustment only when explicitly allowed; cannot escape a named mode band.
- myOdd never stakes; it only creates anonymous booking/share codes.
